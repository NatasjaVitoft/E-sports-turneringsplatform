Application is made as a simple CLI interface, for interacting with the PostgreSQL database.
It is written in C#, and we use Npgsql library as database connector, which is similar to functionality as JDBC in Java.

On starting the program the user is greeted with:

1. Register Player
2. Join Tournament
3. Submit Match Result<br>
q. Quit
